# Deep Review Backlog

## Story vs. Task Terminology

- **Stories** describe end-to-end outcomes that deliver user-visible or systemic
  value. They frame the problem, outline the desired experience, and spell out
  how success is validated (tests, documentation, telemetry). Stories stay
  stable even if implementation steps evolve.
- **Tasks** break a story into concrete engineering steps. They capture focused
  deliverables (implement helper, add fixture, update docs) that collectively
  satisfy the parent story. Tasks can often be completed independently or in
  parallel.
- **Example:** Story 4.1 introduces CLI integration tests. Its tasks cover (a)
  building the reusable harness, (b) writing happy-path coverage, and (c)
  validating failure flows. Finishing the tasks demonstrates the storyâ€™s
  outcome.

## Roadmap

The roadmap table only lists epics that still require planning or delivery work. When an epic lands, move its row to the [epic archive](#epic-archive) so this view stays focused on upcoming priorities. Every entry links to the detailed write-up below for additional context.

| Order | Epic | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [**Epic 8 â€“ Code quality and maintainability**](#epic-8-code-quality-and-maintainability) | ðŸš§ Not started | Break up brittle flows such as `Importer.importTransactions` and `ActualApi.runActualRequest` once determinism and test scaffolding exist, reducing complexity before pursuing roadmap features. |
| 2 | [**Epic 7 â€“ CLI UX**](#epic-7-cli-ux) | ðŸš§ Not started | Improve discoverability and error messaging after the harness, importer guard rails, and observability improvements land, ensuring UX changes are measurable and well-instrumented. |
| 3 | [**Epic 10 â€“ Multi-budget support with observability**](#epic-10-multi-budget-support-with-observability) | ðŸ§­ Discovery mode | Prototype configuration ergonomics, cache invalidation, and logging before attempting multi-budget imports so we do not regress the session lifecycle work. |
| 4 | [**Epic 11 â€“ Configurable data directory override**](#epic-11-configurable-data-directory-override) | ðŸ§­ Discovery mode | Align schema, CLI parsing, and docs around a data-directory override once importer refactors land, keeping diagnostics trustworthy. |
| 5 | [**Epic 12 â€“ Off-budget balance synchronisation**](#epic-12-off-budget-balance-synchronisation) | ðŸ§­ Discovery mode | Model reconciliation workflows that update off-budget accounts without spamming Actual, coordinating with importer refactors for determinism. |

### Epic archive

| Order | Epic | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | [**Epic 4 â€“ CLI usability and coverage**](#epic-4-cli-usability-and-coverage) | âœ… Done | The CLI harness, option validation, and failure propagation stories shipped, so downstream work can assume end-to-end coverage already exists for anything that touches the command surface. |
| 2 | [**Epic 2 â€“ Importer determinism and guard rails**](#epic-2-importer-determinism-and-guard-rails) | âœ… Done | CLI coverage and mapping failure guards ship together, so imports now fail fast when configuration drifts instead of proceeding with partial coverage. |
| 3 | [**Epic 6 â€“ Testing & reliability**](#epic-6-testing--reliability) | âœ… Done | Error-path fixtures, malformed export guards, and structured logging are complete, keeping the CLI observable and resilient under test. |

| 5 | [**Epic 9 â€“ Integration and tooling**](#epic-9-integration-and-tooling) | âœ… Done | Lint/format coverage and onboarding improvements shipped alongside cognitive-complexity checks so the refactored code stays within agreed budgets. |

## Epic 1: Actual session lifecycle resilience

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Done. The session lifecycle guardrails shipped
  across Stories 1.1â€“1.4 with regression coverage in `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`,
  so ongoing work can assume directory resolution, error surfacing, and logging
  are stable foundations.

### Story 1.1 â€“ Resolve the Actual budget directory before `actual.init`

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** `ActualApi.loadBudget` now resolves the sync ID to an on-disk
  budget directory via `resolveBudgetDataDir`, ensuring `actual.init` operates
  against the correct path between runs.
- **Evidence:** The helper scans `metadata.json` files with defensive error
  handling and structured debug logs when a directory is selected. Regression
  coverage exercises multiple directory layouts (`tests/ActualApi.test.ts`).
- **Future Work:** None; follow-up improvements can iterate on the resolver
  directly in `src/utils/ActualApi.ts` if new edge cases appear.

### Story 1.2 â€“ Surface actionable errors when a budget cannot be resolved

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** When no `syncId` match is found, the resolver throws an error
  that lists inspected directories. This prevents silently reusing the fallback
  data path.
- **Evidence:** Error messaging is asserted in `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`, and
  logger output captures the directories checked to aid debugging.
- **Future Work:** Consider tightening the inspected-directory cap
  (`MAX_DIRS_TO_SCAN`) if repositories with more than 100 entries appear.

### Story 1.3 â€“ Guard session reinitialisation across sequential imports

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** Tests execute sequential imports across different budgets to
  ensure `ActualApi` reinitialises between runs and clears state after shutdown.
- **Evidence:** `tests/ActualApi.test.ts` asserts that `init`/`shutdown` pairs
  behave correctly and that distinct sync IDs do not leak data between runs.
- **Future Work:** Additional smoke coverage could validate the same behaviour
  via CLI integration once Story 4.1 lands.

### Story 1.4 â€“ Log directory switches for observability

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** Structured debug logs such as
  `Using budget directory: <dir> for syncId <id>` are emitted whenever the
  resolver switches directories, making lifecycle transitions auditable.
- **Evidence:** Log assertions live in `tests/ActualApi.test.ts` and the
  behaviour is implemented in `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`.
- **Future Work:** None at this time.

## Epic 2: Importer determinism and guard rails

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Done. Stories 2.1â€“2.3 landed together, so importer
  refactors in Epics 8 and 10 can assume deterministic ordering, guarded start
  balances, and fast-fail account mapping validation.

### Story 2.1 â€“ Normalize MoneyMoney transactions before conversion

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** MoneyMoney transactions are now sorted by `valueDate` and a
  deterministic tie-breaker before any importer filtering or conversion so the
  downstream balance calculations and deduplication logic operate on a stable
  sequence.
- **Evidence:** Implemented in `src/utils/Importer.ts` with regression coverage
  in `tests/Importer.test.ts` to confirm ordering and starting-balance
  behaviour.
- **Future Work:** None at this time.

### Story 2.2 â€“ Extend starting balance coverage for missing booked transactions

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** Coverage now exercises importer behaviour when MoneyMoney omits
  booked transactions, ensuring unchecked entries still produce a starting
  balance while disabled unchecked imports continue to emit the generic
  missing-transactions hint to extend the date range or review ignore patterns.
- **Evidence:** `tests/Importer.test.ts` asserts the warning text, hint, and
  synthetic `Starting balance` memo/amount for unchecked-transaction scenarios.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Importer.ts`, `tests/Importer.test.ts`.

### Story 2.3 â€“ Fail imports when account mapping resolution breaks

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** `AccountMap.loadFromConfig` now fails fast when configured
  MoneyMoney or Actual references cannot be resolved during an unconstrained
  import, while filtered runs can still skip unrelated mappings without
  aborting work.
- **Evidence:** Unit coverage in `tests/AccountMap.test.ts` asserts the failure
  messaging and filtered behaviour; CLI integration coverage in
  `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` verifies the surfaced error message
  and shutdown flow.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/AccountMap.ts`, `tests/AccountMap.test.ts`,
  `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts`, `README.md`.
- **Future Work:** None; configuration drift now halts imports with actionable
  guidance.

## Epic 3: Payee transformer resilience

- **Epic Assessment:** ðŸš§ Not started. The payee cache remains a weak
  pointâ€”without automatic healing or payload validation the importer risks stale
  payee names. Prioritising Stories 3.1â€“3.3 would reduce production incidents
  tied to corrupt OpenAI cache data.

### Story 3.1 â€“ Heal corrupt payee cache entries automatically

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** `PayeeTransformer` now detects JSON parse failures when loading
  `openai-model-cache.json`, logs a warning that the cache was reset, and removes
  the corrupt file before refetching the model list so subsequent runs receive a
  fresh cache.
- **Evidence:** The regression coverage in `tests/PayeeTransformer.test.ts`
  stubs a corrupted cache file, asserts the warning, verifies the healed cache
  contents, and confirms a follow-up run uses the regenerated file without
  additional API calls.
- **Future Work:** Consider treating structurally invalid cache payloads (e.g.,
  missing fields) as corrupt to provide the same auto-healing behaviour.

### Story 3.2 â€“ Short-circuit on malformed OpenAI payloads

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** The transformer now detects empty payloads and duplicate keys in
  OpenAI responses, falling back to original payee names with appropriate
  warnings when malformed data is encountered.
- **Evidence:** Implemented in `src/utils/PayeeTransformer.ts` with regression
  coverage in `tests/PayeeTransformer.test.ts` to confirm fallback behavior and
  warning messages for both empty payloads and duplicate key scenarios.
- **Future Work:** None at this time.

### Story 3.3 â€“ Emit structured timing metrics for payee transformation

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** The importer logs total transformation duration but not
  structured timing hints. There is no schema for downstream consumers to parse.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Extend `Logger` usage to emit a consistent object (e.g., start/end
    timestamps and elapsed ms) when `transformPayees` runs.
  - Add assertions in `tests/PayeeTransformer.test.ts` that log shape remains
    backward compatible.
  - Consider adding a metrics hook to bubble timing to CLI-level logs.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/PayeeTransformer.ts`, `src/utils/Logger.ts`,
  `tests/PayeeTransformer.test.ts`.

## Epic 4: CLI usability and coverage

**Epic Assessment:** âœ… Done. Stories 4.1â€“4.3 shipped the harness, option
validation, and failure propagation coverage, so downstream work can rely on
end-to-end CLI tests being available.

### Story 4.1 â€“ Establish CLI integration tests for `import`

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** CLI integration coverage now executes the compiled binary with a
  reusable harness. Tests simulate multiple servers, dry-run imports, and
  invalid account filters by injecting mock Actual/MoneyMoney layers via a
  custom loader.
- **Evidence:** `tests/helpers/cli.ts` builds the CLI once per run,
  `tests/helpers/cli-mock-loader.mjs` records dependency usage, and
  `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` asserts dry-run messaging,
  multi-budget imports, and error propagation.
- **Follow-up:** Future CLI stories can extend the harness with additional
  assertions (e.g., exit-code propagation, help output snapshots).

#### Task 4.1a â€“ Build CLI test harness

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Harness lives in `tests/helpers/cli.ts` and exposes `runCli`,
  `createCliEnv`, and `getCliEntrypoint` helpers that compile the CLI once and
  wire custom Node options.

#### Task 4.1b â€“ Cover positive CLI flows

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` validates dry-run
  messaging, server/budget filtering, and successful execution across multiple
  budgets.

#### Task 4.1c â€“ Exercise negative CLI paths

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** CLI tests assert the mocked importer throws on unknown accounts and
  that the command exits with a non-zero code while still shutting down Actual
  connections.

### Story 4.2 â€“ Clamp `--logLevel` via a yargs coercion hook

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** The CLI now clamps `--logLevel` to the supported 0â€“3 range via a
  yargs coercion hook and throws with actionable guidance when non-numeric
  values are provided, preventing unsupported verbosity settings from leaking
  into commands.
- **Evidence:** `tests/commands/cli-options.command.test.ts` records the
  constructed logger level for high/low inputs, asserts the validation error
  path, and snapshots `--help` output so global option documentation stays in
  sync.
- **Follow-up:** None at this time.

### Story 4.3 â€“ Propagate CLI exit codes for importer failures

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** CLI integration coverage now forces importer failures and
  verifies the process exits with code `1`, confirming the `run().catch`
  boundary surfaces errors to callers instead of silently logging them.
- **Evidence:** `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` asserts the mocked
  importer failure propagates to `stderr` and a non-zero exit code, while
  `tests/helpers/cli-mock-loader.mjs` records the synthetic crash for debugging.
- **Follow-up:** None at this time.

## Epic 5: Observability and developer experience

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Done. Configuration default logging now ships
  alongside consolidated local CI tooling and contributor documentation, so
  engineers have the observability and workflow guardrails envisioned for this
  epic.

### Story 5.1 â€“ Log configuration defaulting decisions

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** `loadConfig` now returns structured defaulting metadata so
  commands can emit debug logs summarising which configuration values fell back
  to defaults.
- **Evidence:** `import.command.ts` logs default usage through
  `logDefaultedConfigDecisions` when DEBUG logging is enabled, and
  `tests/config.test.ts` covers metadata collection and log level gating.
- **Future Work:** Consider surfacing aggregated summaries once additional
  modules start consuming the default metadata.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/config.ts`, `src/utils/Logger.ts`,
  `tests/config.test.ts`.

### Story 5.2 â€“ Provide a consolidated `npm run smoke`

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** The repository provides individual quality gate scripts that can be
  chained together, and the CI matrix mirrors the same gate coverage. Husky's
  `pre-push` hook and the README's development section direct contributors to
  run the quality gates.
- **Evidence:** See the individual scripts in `package.json`, the development
  workflow guidance in `README.md`, and the quality matrix defined in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **Future Work:** None - the individual scripts provide flexibility while
  maintaining the same coverage as the previous consolidated approach.
- **Key Files:** `package.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `README.md`.

### Story 5.3 â€“ Document importer fixture workflow

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** The repository documents importer fixture expectations alongside
  the CLI harness instructions, and the CI workflow continues to execute the
  same suites to validate fixture health on every push and PR.
- **Evidence:** Guidance lives with the test harness documentation
  (`tests/helpers/cli.ts`, `tests/helpers/cli-mock-loader.mjs`), and
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` enforces the lint/type/build/test matrix that
  exercises the importer fixtures.
- **Future Work:** Expand the contributor docs if additional fixture types
  appear, but the current guidance and automation meet the epicâ€™s requirements.
- **Key Files:** `README.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tests/helpers/`.

## Epic 6: Testing & Reliability

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Done. Error-path fixtures, malformed export
  guards, and structured logging schemas now keep the CLI observable and
  resilient under test.

### Story 6.1 â€“ Expand error-path coverage

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** Tests now exercise Actual API network disconnects and credential
  failures via shared fixtures, and the importer rejects malformed MoneyMoney
  exports with actionable errors.
- **Evidence:**
  - `tests/helpers/error-fixtures.ts` centralises failure fixtures for reuse in
    `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`.
  - `tests/ActualApi.test.ts` covers friendly messaging when initialisation
    fails due to network or credential issues.
  - `tests/Importer.test.ts` asserts the importer surfaces guidance when
    MoneyMoney exports omit critical transaction fields.
  - Testing guidelines in `tests/AGENTS.md` outline how to extend the fixtures
    when new failure scenarios surface.
- **Next Steps:** Monitor for additional failure shapes (e.g., TLS errors) to
  expand the fixture catalog as they surface.
- **Key Files:** `tests/helpers/`, `tests/Importer.test.ts`, `tests/AGENTS.md`.

#### Task 6.1a â€“ Shared error fixtures

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Added `tests/helpers/error-fixtures.ts` with reusable network and
  credential failure builders referenced by Actual API suites.

#### Task 6.1b â€“ Malformed export tests

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Importer now guards against incomplete MoneyMoney transactions and
  reports actionable errors backed by regression tests.

#### Task 6.1c â€“ Document new failure scenarios

- **Complexity:** 1 pt
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Documented the shared fixtures and malformed export guidance in
  `tests/AGENTS.md` so future contributors know how to extend coverage.

### Story 6.2 â€“ Standardise debug log schema for observability

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** CLI callers can opt into structured JSON logs, ensuring
  observability tools receive a consistent schema while keeping colourful text
  output as the default experience.
- **Evidence:**
  - `src/utils/Logger.ts` accepts a `structuredLogs` flag and serialises
    messages, timestamps, and normalised hints into JSON payloads.
  - CLI global options expose `--structuredLogs`, flowing through
    `src/index.ts`, command handlers, and CLI harness tests.
  - `tests/utils/Logger.test.ts` asserts the JSON envelope while
    `tests/commands/cli-options.command.test.ts` verifies the new CLI switch.
- **Next Steps:** Monitor downstream tooling for additional fields (e.g.,
  request identifiers) that might warrant schema extensions.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Logger.ts`, `src/index.ts`,
  `tests/utils/Logger.test.ts`, `tests/commands/cli-options.command.test.ts`.

## Epic 7: CLI UX

- **Epic Assessment:** ðŸš§ Not started. User feedback still cites confusing
  `--help` output and opaque error messaging; the stories here depend on Epic
  4â€™s harness to ensure improvements are tested once implemented.

### Story 7.1 â€“ Improve command discoverability

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** `--help` output lacks concrete examples for `import`,
  `sync`, or `resolve` workflows.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Augment command definitions with `.example()` entries demonstrating common
    usage.
  - Snapshot help output in tests to catch regressions when options change.
- **Key Files:** `src/index.ts`, `src/commands/*.ts`, `tests/commands`.

### Story 7.2 â€“ Map backend errors to friendly CLI output

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** Backend errors propagate raw messages. Although
  `ActualApi` has special handling for missing files, the CLI does not translate
  frequent errors into user-friendly text.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Introduce an error translation layer that maps common Actual server errors
    (`file-not-found`, `group-not-found`, HTTP 404) to actionable CLI messages.
  - Add integration tests verifying mappings stay in sync with
    `ActualApi.getFriendlyErrorMessage`.
- **Key Files:** `src/commands/import.command.ts`, `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`,
  `tests/commands`.

## Epic 8: Code quality and maintainability

- **Epic Assessment:** ðŸš§ Not started. High-complexity hotspots like
  `Importer.importTransactions` and `ActualApi.runActualRequest` remain brittle;
  executing these refactors will reduce risk before layering roadmap features.

### Story 8.1 â€“ Refactor retry/resolution logic into reusable helpers

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** Budget directory resolution and retry logic live inline
  within `ActualApi`, making reuse difficult across commands.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Audit resolution touchpoints and design a helper API (likely in
    `src/utils/`) with strong typings.
  - Update importer/CLI callers to use the helper, adding regression tests for
    success and failure flows.
  - Document helper usage and update ADR/backlog notes accordingly.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`, `src/utils/shared.ts`,
  `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`, docs.

#### Task 8.1a â€“ Draft helper API

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Capture configuration inputs/outputs and edge cases before
  refactoring existing code.

#### Task 8.1b â€“ Adopt helper across callers

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Update importer and CLI modules, ensuring tests cover the
  refactored logic.

#### Task 8.1c â€“ Document helper usage

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Update documentation/ADR once helper is established.

### Story 8.2 â€“ Consolidate API error handling into a single class

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** PostError and HTTP errors are handled ad hoc across
  modules, producing inconsistent messaging.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Define a unified error class encapsulating HTTP status, Actual error
    metadata, and user-facing messages.
  - Migrate CLI and logger usage to consume the new class, updating tests
    accordingly.
  - Document the hierarchy for future contributors.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`, `src/commands/import.command.ts`,
  `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`.

#### Task 8.2a â€“ Define consolidated error shape

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Capture required fields (status code, reason, hint) and provide
  helper constructors.

#### Task 8.2b â€“ Update consumers to use the new error class

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Refactor command modules, logger, and tests to leverage the unified
  error handling.

#### Task 8.2c â€“ Document the new error hierarchy

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Add guidance to README/CONTRIBUTING for extending the error
  handling pattern.

### Story 8.3 â€“ Decompose `Importer.importTransactions` into staged pipelines

- **Complexity:** 13 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** `Importer.importTransactions` orchestrates fetching,
  filtering, mapping, and reconciliation in a single ~200 line method. The mix
  of async calls, logging, and state mutation makes it hard to reason about edge
  cases (e.g., dry-run, unchecked filters, synthetic balances) and increases
  regression risk when adding features like off-budget sync.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Map the responsibilities into discrete stages (fetch, filter, transform,
    reconcile, persist) and design composable helpers to isolate concerns.
  - Move pattern matching and transaction conversion into reusable modules with
    targeted unit tests so future changes (e.g., category translation) have
    narrow blast radius.
  - Add high-level integration coverage to ensure stage ordering remains correct
    and dry-run/real modes share behaviour except for side effects.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Importer.ts`, `tests/Importer.test.ts`, future CLI
  integration tests.

#### Task 8.3a â€“ Define importer stage interfaces

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Document inputs/outputs for each stage and capture sequencing
  requirements (e.g., filtering before conversion) to guide refactor.

#### Task 8.3b â€“ Extract filtering and transformation helpers

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Implement new modules/functions for ignore pattern filtering and
  MoneyMoney â†’ Actual transformation with focussed tests.

#### Task 8.3c â€“ Introduce orchestration tests for dry-run vs. live modes

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Add Vitest suites (and future CLI harness coverage) asserting both
  modes pass identical transaction batches to the API while only live mode
  mutates data.

### Story 8.4 â€“ Simplify `ActualApi.runActualRequest` timeout handling

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** The request wrapper coordinates timeouts, console
  patching, shutdown recovery, and friendly errors within one function. Nested
  promises and manual state resets are difficult to test, and regressions could
  leave the Actual client initialised incorrectly after timeouts.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Break timeout orchestration, console suppression, and error translation into
    dedicated utilities with deterministic unit tests.
  - Add targeted tests that simulate slow responses and thrown errors to confirm
    data dir state and logger output stay consistent.
  - Document extension points so new API operations reuse the simplified flow
    without duplicating timeout logic.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`, `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`.

#### Task 8.4a â€“ Extract console patching & logging utilities

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Provide a helper that installs/removes console shims with
  predictable lifecycle hooks for tests.

#### Task 8.4b â€“ Add timeout and shutdown resilience tests

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Use fake timers/mocks to assert that timeouts clear, shutdown is
  attempted once, and state flags reset on failure.

#### Task 8.4c â€“ Refactor run wrapper to compose helpers

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Replace inline logic with the new helpers and update call sites to
  simplify future maintenance.

### Story 8.5 â€“ Modularise CLI import orchestration

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** `handleCommand` inside `src/commands/import.command.ts`
  wires configuration parsing, validation, MoneyMoney checks, Actual session
  lifecycle, and nested server/budget loops in one function. The mixture of data
  shaping, error messaging, and control-flow flags (`dry-run`, filters) makes it
  brittle to extend (e.g., adding multi-budget sync telemetry) and difficult to
  test without duplicating setup in each scenario.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Extract pure helpers for parsing CLI filters, validating configuration
    selections, and iterating over servers/budgets so they can be unit tested
    independently.
  - Introduce higher-level orchestration that composes the helpers and
    coordinates lifecycle logging, keeping the command handler thin.
  - Backfill Vitest coverage for the new helpers plus CLI harness tests (after
    Story 4.1) to confirm dry-run, filter, and failure messaging remain
    unchanged.
- **Key Files:** `src/commands/import.command.ts`,
  `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` (new helpers), `tests/helpers/cli.ts`
  (once harness exists).

#### Task 8.5a â€“ Extract filter parsing & validation helpers

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Move server/budget/account/date parsing into dedicated utilities
  with explicit error messages and add unit tests covering invalid inputs.

#### Task 8.5b â€“ Introduce lifecycle orchestration wrapper

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Implement a coordinator that iterates servers/budgets, instantiates
  dependencies, and handles shutdown with structured logging so the command
  handler delegates to it.

#### Task 8.5c â€“ Cover CLI flows with new helpers

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Add targeted Vitest suites (and future CLI harness tests) verifying
  dry-run messaging, filter combinations, and shutdown resilience using the
  refactored helpers.

## Epic 9: Integration and tooling

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Done. CI now enforces linting, complexity, and
  formatting across application, test, and config code while onboarding docs
  capture the expanded coverage, fulfilling the epicâ€™s integration and tooling
  goals.

### Story 9.1 â€“ Expand CI coverage with linting, type-checking, and matrix builds

- **Complexity:** 13 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines a matrix over Node 20 and 22
  running lint (ESLint + Prettier), type-check, build, and test jobs. Commitlint
  runs separately for commit hygiene.
- **Evidence:** Workflow steps invoke `npm run lint:eslint`,
  `npm run lint:prettier`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`
  with npm caching enabled.
- **Future Work:** Noneâ€”monitor execution times and adjust the matrix if
  additional Node LTS versions are required.

#### Task 9.1a â€“ Add ESLint and Prettier steps to CI

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Implemented in the `quality` job with conditional steps per
  `matrix.task`.

#### Task 9.1b â€“ Add a dedicated `tsc --noEmit` job

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** The matrix includes a `typecheck` task invoking
  `npm run typecheck`.

#### Task 9.1c â€“ Configure GitHub Actions matrix builds for Node LTS

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Node versions 20 and 22 run across all tasks with npm caching.

### Story 9.2 â€“ Improve developer onboarding

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** Added a comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md`, refreshed the README
  with a developer onboarding section, and aligned the `.coderabbit` knowledge
  base with the new guidance.
- **Key Files:** `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.coderabbit.yaml`.

### Story 9.3 â€“ Enforce cyclomatic complexity budgets via ESLint

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** Added `eslint-plugin-sonarjs`-backed rules that cap function
  cyclomatic complexity at 40 and cognitive complexity at 60. The guard rails
  are available through `npm run lint:complexity`, which CI and the local smoke
  test invoke alongside the existing lint workflow.
- **Evidence:** `eslint.config.mjs` gates the plugin via
  `ENABLE_COMPLEXITY_RULES`, `package.json` exposes the dedicated script,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs it in the lint matrix, and contributing docs
  explain how to respond to violations.
- **Follow-up:** Monitor importer-heavy functions; if budgets prove too strict,
  adjust thresholds with design discussion rather than disabling the rule ad
  hoc.

### Story 9.4 â€“ Align lint and formatter coverage with active code paths

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** `eslint.config.mjs` now lints the source, test, and TypeScript
  configuration files with Vitest globals for tests, while the npm scripts call
  ESLint against the repository root. Prettier runs over the same surface area
  except for Markdown, which is formatted by `mdformat` to stay compatible with
  CodeRabbitâ€™s suggestions; the shared `.prettierignore` skips generated
  artifacts and `.md` files, and contributor docs spell out the split tooling
  and how to extend it.
- **Evidence:** Updated ESLint flat config, root-level lint/format scripts in
  `package.json`, the refined `.prettierignore`, and refreshed guidance in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` all landed together with the CI matrix continuing to
  exercise the expanded commands.
- **Future Work:** Noneâ€”add directories to the lint/format scope by updating
  `eslint.config.mjs` and `.prettierignore` when new code paths are introduced.

## Epic 10: Multi-budget support with observability

- **Epic Assessment:** Ambitious but plausible once Epic 8 refactors land.
  Actualâ€™s Node bindings support switching sync IDs, yet we must prove cache
  invalidation, credential reuse, and logging expectations so we do not regress
  the session lifecycle work in Epic 1.

### Story 10.1 â€“ Model configuration and persistence

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Draft ADR/design doc covering configuration schema updates and
  storage of per-budget metadata, including edge-case handling for credential
  reuse and partial failures.

  and document open questions around state persistence between runs.
- **Key Files:** docs, design docs.

### Story 10.2 â€“ Implement runtime support and tests

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Update importer/CLI flows with regression tests ensuring session
  resets between budgets while preserving logging clarity and failure
  propagation.
- **Next Steps:** Extend `ActualApi` helpers, add CLI integration tests, and
  verify sequential budget imports remain deterministic.
- **Key Files:** `src/commands/import.command.ts`, `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`,
  `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts`.

### Story 10.3 â€“ Add telemetry and documentation

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Enhance logging/metrics and write user-facing docs explaining how
  budget switching works, including troubleshooting guidance for partial
  failures.
- **Next Steps:** Define structured log schemas, add CLI surfacing, and expand
  README/backlog sections covering multi-budget workflows.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Logger.ts`, docs.

## Epic 11: Configurable data directory override

- **Epic Assessment:** Clear operator ask with manageable scope. We must audit
  touchpoints that assume the default path and document how overrides interact
  with existing auto-discovery so diagnostics remain accurate.

### Story 11.1 â€“ Extend configuration and CLI parsing

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Update the Zod schema, CLI options, and default resolution logic
  to accept a data-directory override with validation and descriptive errors.
- **Next Steps:** Align configuration parsing with CLI flags/environment
  variables and capture migration notes.
- **Key Files:** `src/index.ts`, `src/utils/shared.ts`, `src/utils/config.ts`.

### Story 11.2 â€“ Update tests and documentation

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Add coverage in config and CLI tests plus README/backlog updates
  showing how the override behaves alongside auto-discovery.
- **Next Steps:** Exercise positive/negative override scenarios in tests and
  document expected directory resolution order.
- **Key Files:** `tests/config.test.ts`, `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts`,
  docs.

### Story 11.3 â€“ Maintain backward compatibility guidance

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Document migration steps and ensure defaults remain unchanged
  unless overrides are provided so operators can adopt the feature safely.
- **Next Steps:** Draft release notes/backlog guidance and review messaging with
  stakeholders.
- **Key Files:** docs.

## Epic 12: Off-budget balance synchronisation

- **Epic Assessment:** Valuable for parity with MoneyMoney but requires careful
  design. MoneyMoneyâ€™s API only exposes point-in-time balances, so we must
  guarantee idempotent reconciliation entries and avoid noisy updates.

### Story 12.1 â€“ Model configuration for off-budget balance sync

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Allow accounts to opt into reconciliation, including category
  mapping and memo defaults with validation for unsupported account types.
- **Next Steps:** Extend configuration schema, capture operator expectations,
  and document guard rails.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/config.ts`, docs.

### Story 12.2 â€“ Implement reconciliation transaction generation

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Extend importer logic to compute deltas, emit reconciliation
  transactions, and ensure idempotency across runs.
- **Next Steps:** Add importer helpers, update CLI flows, and create regression
  coverage for positive/negative delta cases.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Importer.ts`, `src/commands/import.command.ts`,
  `tests/Importer.test.ts`.

### Story 12.3 â€“ Document and test off-budget reconciliation

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Cover positive/negative delta cases in unit tests and update
  README/backlog guidance describing how synthetic entries appear in Actual.
- **Next Steps:** Expand docs with troubleshooting tips and ensure examples show
  reconciliation categories.
- **Key Files:** `tests/Importer.test.ts`, docs.

## Epic 13: MoneyMoney category translation

- **Epic Assessment:** Reasonable stretch goal once configuration ergonomics
  improve. Requires confirmation that we can reliably address Actual categories
  by stable IDs and that MoneyMoney exports carry sufficient identifiers.

### Story 13.1 â€“ Define category translation configuration

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Extend the config schema with optional mapping blocks and surface
  validation errors when categories are missing or ambiguous.
- **Next Steps:** Prototype mapping ergonomics, gather operator feedback, and
  document fallback behaviour.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/config.ts`, docs.

### Story 13.2 â€“ Apply translations with importer coverage

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Outcome:** Update importer logic/tests to apply mappings, ensuring unlisted
  categories fall back gracefully with warnings and structured logs.
- **Next Steps:** Implement translation helpers, add regression tests, and keep
  CLI output clear about fallback scenarios.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Importer.ts`, `tests/Importer.test.ts`.

### Story 13.3 â€“ Document category translation workflows

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
