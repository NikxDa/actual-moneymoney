# Deep Review Backlog

## Story vs. Task Terminology

- **Stories** describe end-to-end outcomes that deliver user-visible or systemic
  value. They frame the problem, outline the desired experience, and spell out
  how success is validated (tests, documentation, telemetry). Stories stay
  stable even if implementation steps evolve.
- **Tasks** break a story into concrete engineering steps. They capture focused
  deliverables (implement helper, add fixture, update docs) that collectively
  satisfy the parent story. Tasks can often be completed independently or in
  parallel.
- **Example:** Story 4.1 introduces CLI integration tests. Its tasks cover (a)
  building the reusable harness, (b) writing happy-path coverage, and (c)
  validating failure flows. Finishing the tasks demonstrates the storyâ€™s
  outcome.

## Recommended Epic Delivery Order

| Order | Epic | State | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | **Epic 4 â€“ CLI usability and coverage** | âœ… Completed | The CLI harness, option validation, and failure propagation stories shipped, so downstream work can assume end-to-end coverage already exists for anything that touches the command surface. |
| 2 | **Epic 2 â€“ Importer determinism and guard rails** | ðŸš§ In progress (not yet started) | With CLI coverage in place we can harden importer ordering, starting-balance handling, and mapping failures so downstream refactors and new features have a predictable foundation. |
| 3 | **Epic 6 â€“ Testing & reliability** | ðŸš§ In progress | Shared failure fixtures and importer guards now cover credential, network, and malformed-export flows; structured log schema work remains to finish the epic. |
| 4 | **Epic 8 â€“ Code quality and maintainability** | ðŸš§ Not started | Break up brittle flows such as `Importer.importTransactions` and `ActualApi.runActualRequest` once determinism and test scaffolding exist, reducing complexity before pursuing roadmap features. |
| 5 | **Epic 5 â€“ Observability and developer experience** | âœ… Completed | Smoke coverage, default logging, and contributor docs are live, giving follow-on epics the observability and workflow guard rails they depend on. |
| 6 | **Epic 9 â€“ Integration and tooling** | âœ… Completed | Extend lint/format coverage and onboarding once smoke scripts exist, and enable cognitive-complexity checks so the refactored code stays within agreed budgets. |
| 7 | **Epic 7 â€“ CLI UX** | ðŸš§ Not started | Improve discoverability and error messaging after the harness, importer guard rails, and observability improvements land, ensuring UX changes are measurable and well-instrumented. |
| 8 | **Epic 10 â€“ Roadmap features** | ðŸ§­ Discovery mode | Tackle multi-budget support, configurable data directories, and category translation lastâ€”each relies on the importer/CLI refactors and extended tooling to mitigate risk. |

## Epic 1: Actual session lifecycle resilience

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Completed. The session lifecycle guardrails shipped
  across Stories 1.1â€“1.4 with regression coverage in `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`,
  so ongoing work can assume directory resolution, error surfacing, and logging
  are stable foundations.

### Story 1.1 â€“ Resolve the Actual budget directory before `actual.init`

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** `ActualApi.loadBudget` now resolves the sync ID to an on-disk
  budget directory via `resolveBudgetDataDir`, ensuring `actual.init` operates
  against the correct path between runs.
- **Evidence:** The helper scans `metadata.json` files with defensive error
  handling and structured debug logs when a directory is selected. Regression
  coverage exercises multiple directory layouts (`tests/ActualApi.test.ts`).
- **Future Work:** None; follow-up improvements can iterate on the resolver
  directly in `src/utils/ActualApi.ts` if new edge cases appear.

### Story 1.2 â€“ Surface actionable errors when a budget cannot be resolved

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** When no `syncId` match is found, the resolver throws an error
  that lists inspected directories. This prevents silently reusing the fallback
  data path.
- **Evidence:** Error messaging is asserted in `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`, and
  logger output captures the directories checked to aid debugging.
- **Future Work:** Consider tightening the inspected-directory cap
  (`MAX_DIRS_TO_SCAN`) if repositories with more than 100 entries appear.

### Story 1.3 â€“ Guard session reinitialisation across sequential imports

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** Tests execute sequential imports across different budgets to
  ensure `ActualApi` reinitialises between runs and clears state after shutdown.
- **Evidence:** `tests/ActualApi.test.ts` asserts that `init`/`shutdown` pairs
  behave correctly and that distinct sync IDs do not leak data between runs.
- **Future Work:** Additional smoke coverage could validate the same behaviour
  via CLI integration once Story 4.1 lands.

### Story 1.4 â€“ Log directory switches for observability

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** Structured debug logs such as
  `Using budget directory: <dir> for syncId <id>` are emitted whenever the
  resolver switches directories, making lifecycle transitions auditable.
- **Evidence:** Log assertions live in `tests/ActualApi.test.ts` and the
  behaviour is implemented in `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`.
- **Future Work:** None at this time.

## Epic 2: Importer determinism and guard rails

- **Epic Assessment:** ðŸš§ In progress (not yet started). Importer flows still
  rely on implicit ordering and best-effort warnings; landing Stories 2.1â€“2.3
  will unlock confident refactors in Epics 8 and 10 by hardening transaction
  normalisation and mapping validation.

### Story 2.1 â€“ Normalize MoneyMoney transactions before conversion

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** MoneyMoney transactions are now sorted by `valueDate` and a
  deterministic tie-breaker before any importer filtering or conversion so the
  downstream balance calculations and deduplication logic operate on a stable
  sequence.
- **Evidence:** Implemented in `src/utils/Importer.ts` with regression coverage
  in `tests/Importer.test.ts` to confirm ordering and starting-balance
  behaviour.
- **Future Work:** None at this time.

### Story 2.2 â€“ Extend starting balance coverage for missing booked transactions

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** Coverage now exercises importer behaviour when MoneyMoney omits
  booked transactions, ensuring unchecked entries still produce a starting
  balance while disabled unchecked imports continue to emit the generic
  missing-transactions hint to extend the date range or review ignore patterns.
- **Evidence:** `tests/Importer.test.ts` asserts the warning text, hint, and
  synthetic `Starting balance` memo/amount for unchecked-transaction scenarios.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Importer.ts`, `tests/Importer.test.ts`.

### Story 2.3 â€“ Fail imports when account mapping resolution breaks

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** `AccountMap.loadFromConfig` logs and skips unresolved
  mappings rather than failing fast, so `import` can proceed silently with
  partial coverage.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Make `loadFromConfig` throw when either side of a configured mapping cannot
    be resolved during an unconstrained import.
  - Add CLI-level tests (`tests/commands`) to assert the surfaced error message
    when mappings fail.
  - Document the failure mode in the README/backlog so operators know to fix
    configuration.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/AccountMap.ts`,
  `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` (new).

## Epic 3: Payee transformer resilience

- **Epic Assessment:** ðŸš§ Not started. The payee cache remains a weak
  pointâ€”without automatic healing or payload validation the importer risks stale
  payee names. Prioritising Stories 3.1â€“3.3 would reduce production incidents
  tied to corrupt OpenAI cache data.

### Story 3.1 â€“ Heal corrupt payee cache entries automatically

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** `PayeeTransformer` now detects JSON parse failures when loading
  `openai-model-cache.json`, logs a warning that the cache was reset, and removes
  the corrupt file before refetching the model list so subsequent runs receive a
  fresh cache.
- **Evidence:** The regression coverage in `tests/PayeeTransformer.test.ts`
  stubs a corrupted cache file, asserts the warning, verifies the healed cache
  contents, and confirms a follow-up run uses the regenerated file without
  additional API calls.
- **Future Work:** Consider treating structurally invalid cache payloads (e.g.,
  missing fields) as corrupt to provide the same auto-healing behaviour.

### Story 3.2 â€“ Short-circuit on malformed OpenAI payloads

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** The transformer caches any parsed JSON object, even
  when the payload is empty or contains duplicate keys, leading to stale names
  being reused.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Detect empty payloads or duplicate keys and fall back to original payee
    names with a warning.
  - Extend tests with fixtures covering duplicate/empty responses to assert the
    fallback path and logging hints.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/PayeeTransformer.ts`,
  `tests/PayeeTransformer.test.ts`.

### Story 3.3 â€“ Emit structured timing metrics for payee transformation

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** The importer logs total transformation duration but not
  structured timing hints. There is no schema for downstream consumers to parse.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Extend `Logger` usage to emit a consistent object (e.g., start/end
    timestamps and elapsed ms) when `transformPayees` runs.
  - Add assertions in `tests/PayeeTransformer.test.ts` that log shape remains
    backward compatible.
  - Consider adding a metrics hook to bubble timing to CLI-level logs.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/PayeeTransformer.ts`, `src/utils/Logger.ts`,
  `tests/PayeeTransformer.test.ts`.

## Epic 4: CLI usability and coverage

**Epic Assessment:** âœ… Completed. Stories 4.1â€“4.3 shipped the harness, option
validation, and failure propagation coverage, so downstream work can rely on
end-to-end CLI tests being available.

### Story 4.1 â€“ Establish CLI integration tests for `import`

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** CLI integration coverage now executes the compiled binary with a
  reusable harness. Tests simulate multiple servers, dry-run imports, and
  invalid account filters by injecting mock Actual/MoneyMoney layers via a
  custom loader.
- **Evidence:** `tests/helpers/cli.ts` builds the CLI once per run,
  `tests/helpers/cli-mock-loader.mjs` records dependency usage, and
  `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` asserts dry-run messaging,
  multi-budget imports, and error propagation.
- **Follow-up:** Future CLI stories can extend the harness with additional
  assertions (e.g., exit-code propagation, help output snapshots).

#### Task 4.1a â€“ Build CLI test harness

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Harness lives in `tests/helpers/cli.ts` and exposes `runCli`,
  `createCliEnv`, and `getCliEntrypoint` helpers that compile the CLI once and
  wire custom Node options.

#### Task 4.1b â€“ Cover positive CLI flows

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` validates dry-run
  messaging, server/budget filtering, and successful execution across multiple
  budgets.

#### Task 4.1c â€“ Exercise negative CLI paths

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** CLI tests assert the mocked importer throws on unknown accounts and
  that the command exits with a non-zero code while still shutting down Actual
  connections.

### Story 4.2 â€“ Clamp `--logLevel` via a yargs coercion hook

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** The CLI now clamps `--logLevel` to the supported 0â€“3 range via a
  yargs coercion hook and throws with actionable guidance when non-numeric
  values are provided, preventing unsupported verbosity settings from leaking
  into commands.
- **Evidence:** `tests/commands/cli-options.command.test.ts` records the
  constructed logger level for high/low inputs, asserts the validation error
  path, and snapshots `--help` output so global option documentation stays in
  sync.
- **Follow-up:** None at this time.

### Story 4.3 â€“ Propagate CLI exit codes for importer failures

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** CLI integration coverage now forces importer failures and
  verifies the process exits with code `1`, confirming the `run().catch`
  boundary surfaces errors to callers instead of silently logging them.
- **Evidence:** `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` asserts the mocked
  importer failure propagates to `stderr` and a non-zero exit code, while
  `tests/helpers/cli-mock-loader.mjs` records the synthetic crash for debugging.
- **Follow-up:** None at this time.

## Epic 5: Observability and developer experience

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Completed. Configuration default logging now ships
  alongside consolidated local CI tooling and contributor documentation, so
  engineers have the observability and workflow guardrails envisioned for this
  epic.

### Story 5.1 â€“ Log configuration defaulting decisions

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** `loadConfig` now returns structured defaulting metadata so
  commands can emit debug logs summarising which configuration values fell back
  to defaults.
- **Evidence:** `import.command.ts` logs default usage through
  `logDefaultedConfigDecisions` when DEBUG logging is enabled, and
  `tests/config.test.ts` covers metadata collection and log level gating.
- **Future Work:** Consider surfacing aggregated summaries once additional
  modules start consuming the default metadata.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/config.ts`, `src/utils/Logger.ts`,
  `tests/config.test.ts`.

### Story 5.2 â€“ Provide a consolidated `npm run smoke`

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** The repository already exposes the `npm run ci:local` helper,
  which chains the ESLint, Prettier, type-check, build, and test steps. Huskyâ€™s
  `pre-push` hook and the READMEâ€™s development section direct contributors to
  the script, and the CI matrix mirrors the same gate coverage.
- **Evidence:** See the `ci:local` script in `package.json`, the development
  workflow guidance in `README.md`, and the quality matrix defined in
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
- **Future Work:** Consider aliasing `npm run smoke` to `npm run ci:local` if
  contributors prefer the alternate naming, but no functionality gaps remain
  today.
- **Key Files:** `package.json`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `README.md`.

### Story 5.3 â€“ Document importer fixture workflow

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** The repository documents importer fixture expectations alongside
  the CLI harness instructions, and the CI workflow continues to execute the
  same suites to validate fixture health on every push and PR.
- **Evidence:** Guidance lives with the test harness documentation
  (`tests/helpers/cli.ts`, `tests/helpers/cli-mock-loader.mjs`), and
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` enforces the lint/type/build/test matrix that
  exercises the importer fixtures.
- **Future Work:** Expand the contributor docs if additional fixture types
  appear, but the current guidance and automation meet the epicâ€™s requirements.
- **Key Files:** `README.md`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, `tests/helpers/`.

## Epic 6: Testing & Reliability

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Completed. Error-path fixtures, malformed export
  guards, and structured logging schemas now keep the CLI observable and
  resilient under test.

### Story 6.1 â€“ Expand error-path coverage

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** Tests now exercise Actual API network disconnects and credential
  failures via shared fixtures, and the importer rejects malformed MoneyMoney
  exports with actionable errors.
- **Evidence:**
  - `tests/helpers/error-fixtures.ts` centralises failure fixtures for reuse in
    `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`.
  - `tests/ActualApi.test.ts` covers friendly messaging when initialisation
    fails due to network or credential issues.
  - `tests/Importer.test.ts` asserts the importer surfaces guidance when
    MoneyMoney exports omit critical transaction fields.
  - Documentation in `docs/testing.md` captures the new failure scenarios for
    contributors.
- **Next Steps:** Monitor for additional failure shapes (e.g., TLS errors) to
  expand the fixture catalog as they surface.
- **Key Files:** `tests/helpers/`, `tests/Importer.test.ts`, `docs/testing.md`.

#### Task 6.1a â€“ Shared error fixtures

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Added `tests/helpers/error-fixtures.ts` with reusable network and
  credential failure builders referenced by Actual API suites.

#### Task 6.1b â€“ Malformed export tests

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Importer now guards against incomplete MoneyMoney transactions and
  reports actionable errors backed by regression tests.

#### Task 6.1c â€“ Document new failure scenarios

- **Complexity:** 1 pt
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Documented the shared fixtures and malformed export guidance in
  `docs/testing.md` for future contributors.

### Story 6.2 â€“ Standardise debug log schema for observability

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** CLI callers can opt into structured JSON logs, ensuring
  observability tools receive a consistent schema while keeping colourful text
  output as the default experience.
- **Evidence:**
  - `src/utils/Logger.ts` accepts a `structuredLogs` flag and serialises
    messages, timestamps, and normalised hints into JSON payloads.
  - CLI global options expose `--structuredLogs`, flowing through
    `src/index.ts`, command handlers, and CLI harness tests.
  - `tests/utils/Logger.test.ts` asserts the JSON envelope while
    `tests/commands/cli-options.command.test.ts` verifies the new CLI switch.
- **Next Steps:** Monitor downstream tooling for additional fields (e.g.,
  request identifiers) that might warrant schema extensions.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Logger.ts`, `src/index.ts`,
  `tests/utils/Logger.test.ts`, `tests/commands/cli-options.command.test.ts`.

## Epic 7: CLI UX

- **Epic Assessment:** ðŸš§ Not started. User feedback still cites confusing
  `--help` output and opaque error messaging; the stories here depend on Epic
  4â€™s harness to ensure improvements are tested once implemented.

### Story 7.1 â€“ Improve command discoverability

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** `--help` output lacks concrete examples for `import`,
  `sync`, or `resolve` workflows.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Augment command definitions with `.example()` entries demonstrating common
    usage.
  - Snapshot help output in tests to catch regressions when options change.
- **Key Files:** `src/index.ts`, `src/commands/*.ts`, `tests/commands`.

### Story 7.2 â€“ Map backend errors to friendly CLI output

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** Backend errors propagate raw messages. Although
  `ActualApi` has special handling for missing files, the CLI does not translate
  frequent errors into user-friendly text.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Introduce an error translation layer that maps common Actual server errors
    (`file-not-found`, `group-not-found`, HTTP 404) to actionable CLI messages.
  - Add integration tests verifying mappings stay in sync with
    `ActualApi.getFriendlyErrorMessage`.
- **Key Files:** `src/commands/import.command.ts`, `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`,
  `tests/commands`.

## Epic 8: Code quality and maintainability

- **Epic Assessment:** ðŸš§ Not started. High-complexity hotspots like
  `Importer.importTransactions` and `ActualApi.runActualRequest` remain brittle;
  executing these refactors will reduce risk before layering roadmap features.

### Story 8.1 â€“ Refactor retry/resolution logic into reusable helpers

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** Budget directory resolution and retry logic live inline
  within `ActualApi`, making reuse difficult across commands.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Audit resolution touchpoints and design a helper API (likely in
    `src/utils/`) with strong typings.
  - Update importer/CLI callers to use the helper, adding regression tests for
    success and failure flows.
  - Document helper usage and update ADR/backlog notes accordingly.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`, `src/utils/shared.ts`,
  `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`, docs.

#### Task 8.1a â€“ Draft helper API

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Capture configuration inputs/outputs and edge cases before
  refactoring existing code.

#### Task 8.1b â€“ Adopt helper across callers

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Update importer and CLI modules, ensuring tests cover the
  refactored logic.

#### Task 8.1c â€“ Document helper usage

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Update documentation/ADR once helper is established.

### Story 8.2 â€“ Consolidate API error handling into a single class

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** PostError and HTTP errors are handled ad hoc across
  modules, producing inconsistent messaging.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Define a unified error class encapsulating HTTP status, Actual error
    metadata, and user-facing messages.
  - Migrate CLI and logger usage to consume the new class, updating tests
    accordingly.
  - Document the hierarchy for future contributors.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`, `src/commands/import.command.ts`,
  `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`.

#### Task 8.2a â€“ Define consolidated error shape

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Capture required fields (status code, reason, hint) and provide
  helper constructors.

#### Task 8.2b â€“ Update consumers to use the new error class

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Refactor command modules, logger, and tests to leverage the unified
  error handling.

#### Task 8.2c â€“ Document the new error hierarchy

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Add guidance to README/CONTRIBUTING for extending the error
  handling pattern.

### Story 8.3 â€“ Decompose `Importer.importTransactions` into staged pipelines

- **Complexity:** 13 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** `Importer.importTransactions` orchestrates fetching,
  filtering, mapping, and reconciliation in a single ~200 line method. The mix
  of async calls, logging, and state mutation makes it hard to reason about edge
  cases (e.g., dry-run, unchecked filters, synthetic balances) and increases
  regression risk when adding features like off-budget sync.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Map the responsibilities into discrete stages (fetch, filter, transform,
    reconcile, persist) and design composable helpers to isolate concerns.
  - Move pattern matching and transaction conversion into reusable modules with
    targeted unit tests so future changes (e.g., category translation) have
    narrow blast radius.
  - Add high-level integration coverage to ensure stage ordering remains correct
    and dry-run/real modes share behaviour except for side effects.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Importer.ts`, `tests/Importer.test.ts`, future CLI
  integration tests.

#### Task 8.3a â€“ Define importer stage interfaces

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Document inputs/outputs for each stage and capture sequencing
  requirements (e.g., filtering before conversion) to guide refactor.

#### Task 8.3b â€“ Extract filtering and transformation helpers

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Implement new modules/functions for ignore pattern filtering and
  MoneyMoney â†’ Actual transformation with focussed tests.

#### Task 8.3c â€“ Introduce orchestration tests for dry-run vs. live modes

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Add Vitest suites (and future CLI harness coverage) asserting both
  modes pass identical transaction batches to the API while only live mode
  mutates data.

### Story 8.4 â€“ Simplify `ActualApi.runActualRequest` timeout handling

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** The request wrapper coordinates timeouts, console
  patching, shutdown recovery, and friendly errors within one function. Nested
  promises and manual state resets are difficult to test, and regressions could
  leave the Actual client initialised incorrectly after timeouts.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Break timeout orchestration, console suppression, and error translation into
    dedicated utilities with deterministic unit tests.
  - Add targeted tests that simulate slow responses and thrown errors to confirm
    data dir state and logger output stay consistent.
  - Document extension points so new API operations reuse the simplified flow
    without duplicating timeout logic.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`, `tests/ActualApi.test.ts`.

#### Task 8.4a â€“ Extract console patching & logging utilities

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Provide a helper that installs/removes console shims with
  predictable lifecycle hooks for tests.

#### Task 8.4b â€“ Add timeout and shutdown resilience tests

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Use fake timers/mocks to assert that timeouts clear, shutdown is
  attempted once, and state flags reset on failure.

#### Task 8.4c â€“ Refactor run wrapper to compose helpers

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Replace inline logic with the new helpers and update call sites to
  simplify future maintenance.

### Story 8.5 â€“ Modularise CLI import orchestration

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** `handleCommand` inside `src/commands/import.command.ts`
  wires configuration parsing, validation, MoneyMoney checks, Actual session
  lifecycle, and nested server/budget loops in one function. The mixture of data
  shaping, error messaging, and control-flow flags (`dry-run`, filters) makes it
  brittle to extend (e.g., adding multi-budget sync telemetry) and difficult to
  test without duplicating setup in each scenario.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Extract pure helpers for parsing CLI filters, validating configuration
    selections, and iterating over servers/budgets so they can be unit tested
    independently.
  - Introduce higher-level orchestration that composes the helpers and
    coordinates lifecycle logging, keeping the command handler thin.
  - Backfill Vitest coverage for the new helpers plus CLI harness tests (after
    Story 4.1) to confirm dry-run, filter, and failure messaging remain
    unchanged.
- **Key Files:** `src/commands/import.command.ts`,
  `tests/commands/import.command.test.ts` (new helpers), `tests/helpers/cli.ts`
  (once harness exists).

#### Task 8.5a â€“ Extract filter parsing & validation helpers

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Move server/budget/account/date parsing into dedicated utilities
  with explicit error messages and add unit tests covering invalid inputs.

#### Task 8.5b â€“ Introduce lifecycle orchestration wrapper

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Implement a coordinator that iterates servers/budgets, instantiates
  dependencies, and handles shutdown with structured logging so the command
  handler delegates to it.

#### Task 8.5c â€“ Cover CLI flows with new helpers

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Add targeted Vitest suites (and future CLI harness tests) verifying
  dry-run messaging, filter combinations, and shutdown resilience using the
  refactored helpers.

## Epic 9: Integration and tooling

- **Epic Assessment:** âœ… Completed. CI now enforces linting, complexity, and
  formatting across application, test, and config code while onboarding docs
  capture the expanded coverage, fulfilling the epicâ€™s integration and tooling
  goals.

### Story 9.1 â€“ Expand CI coverage with linting, type-checking, and matrix builds

- **Complexity:** 13 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Context:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml` defines a matrix over Node 20 and 22
  running lint (ESLint + Prettier), type-check, build, and test jobs. Commitlint
  runs separately for commit hygiene.
- **Evidence:** Workflow steps invoke `npm run lint:eslint`,
  `npm run lint:prettier`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, and `npm test`
  with npm caching enabled.
- **Future Work:** Noneâ€”monitor execution times and adjust the matrix if
  additional Node LTS versions are required.

#### Task 9.1a â€“ Add ESLint and Prettier steps to CI

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Implemented in the `quality` job with conditional steps per
  `matrix.task`.

#### Task 9.1b â€“ Add a dedicated `tsc --noEmit` job

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** The matrix includes a `typecheck` task invoking
  `npm run typecheck`.

#### Task 9.1c â€“ Configure GitHub Actions matrix builds for Node LTS

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Notes:** Node versions 20 and 22 run across all tasks with npm caching.

### Story 9.2 â€“ Improve developer onboarding

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** Added a comprehensive `CONTRIBUTING.md`, refreshed the README
  with a developer onboarding section, and aligned the `.coderabbit` knowledge
  base with the new guidance.

### Story 9.3 â€“ Enforce cyclomatic complexity budgets via ESLint

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** Added `eslint-plugin-sonarjs`-backed rules that cap function
  cyclomatic complexity at 40 and cognitive complexity at 60. The guard rails
  are available through `npm run lint:complexity`, which CI and the local smoke
  test invoke alongside the existing lint workflow.
- **Evidence:** `eslint.config.mjs` gates the plugin via
  `ENABLE_COMPLEXITY_RULES`, `package.json` exposes the dedicated script,
  `.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs it in the lint matrix, and contributing docs
  explain how to respond to violations.
- **Follow-up:** Monitor importer-heavy functions; if budgets prove too strict,
  adjust thresholds with design discussion rather than disabling the rule ad
  hoc.

### Story 9.4 â€“ Align lint and formatter coverage with active code paths

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** âœ… Done
- **Outcome:** `eslint.config.mjs` now lints the source, test, and TypeScript
  configuration files with Vitest globals for tests, while the npm scripts call
  ESLint against the repository root. Prettier runs over the same surface area
  except for Markdown, which is formatted by `mdformat` to stay compatible with
  CodeRabbitâ€™s suggestions; the shared `.prettierignore` skips generated
  artifacts and `.md` files, and contributor docs spell out the split tooling
  and how to extend it.
- **Evidence:** Updated ESLint flat config, root-level lint/format scripts in
  `package.json`, the refined `.prettierignore`, and refreshed guidance in
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` all landed together with the CI matrix continuing to
  exercise the expanded commands.
- **Future Work:** Noneâ€”add directories to the lint/format scope by updating
  `eslint.config.mjs` and `.prettierignore` when new code paths are introduced.

## Epic 10: Roadmap features

- **Epic Assessment:** These roadmap ideas align with user requests but each
  hinges on earlier refactors (Epics 2, 4, and 8) to reduce implementation risk.
  They should stay in discovery mode until we prototype configuration ergonomics
  and CLI harness coverage so we can prove the UX end-to-end without regressing
  existing stability work.

### Story 10.1 â€“ Deliver multi-budget support with observability

- **Complexity:** 13 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** The importer processes one budget at a time per server.
  There is no persistence for multi-budget state beyond the existing
  configuration schema.
- **Assessment:** Ambitious but plausible once Epic 8 refactors land. Actualâ€™s
  Node bindings support switching sync IDs, yet we would need design spikes to
  confirm cache invalidation, credential reuse, and logging expectations so we
  do not regress the session lifecycle work in Epic 1. High discovery risk
  remains around how operators expect to configure multiple budgets per server
  and how we surface partial failures in CLI output.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Model multi-budget configuration requirements and capture design notes
    covering edge cases.
  - Implement runtime support for switching budgets with tests across session
    lifecycles and logging enhancements.
  - Document multi-budget workflows for operators.
- **Key Files:** `src/commands/import.command.ts`, `src/utils/ActualApi.ts`,
  docs.

#### Task 10.1a â€“ Model configuration and persistence

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Draft ADR/design doc covering configuration schema updates and
  storage of per-budget metadata.

#### Task 10.1b â€“ Implement runtime support and tests

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Update importer/CLI flows with regression tests ensuring session
  resets between budgets.

#### Task 10.1c â€“ Add telemetry and documentation

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Enhance logging and write user-facing docs explaining budget
  switching.

### Story 10.2 â€“ Provide a configurable data directory override

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** `DEFAULT_DATA_DIR` is fixed; there is no CLI flag or
  environment variable to override the data directory.
- **Assessment:** Clear operator ask with manageable scope. We must audit all
  touchpoints that assume the default path (tests, docs, resolver helpers) and
  document how overrides interact with existing auto-discovery so that
  diagnostics (e.g., Story 1.2 error messages) remain accurate. Expect churn in
  onboarding docs but low technical risk once schema validation is in place.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Extend the configuration schema and CLI parsing to accept an override (via
    env var or flag) with validation.
  - Update integration tests/documentation to cover the new option and ensure
    backward compatibility.
  - Emit migration guidance for existing setups that rely on the default path.
- **Key Files:** `src/index.ts`, `src/utils/shared.ts`, `src/utils/config.ts`,
  docs, tests.

#### Task 10.2a â€“ Extend configuration/CLI parsing

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Update Zod schema, CLI options, and default resolution logic.

#### Task 10.2b â€“ Update tests and documentation

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Add coverage in config and CLI tests plus README/backlog updates.

#### Task 10.2c â€“ Maintain backward compatibility guidance

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Document migration steps and ensure defaults remain unchanged
  unless overrides are provided.

### Story 10.3 â€“ Sync off-budget account balances automatically

- **Complexity:** 8 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** Off-budget accounts (e.g., investment portfolios) are
  ignored after initial import, so Actual balances drift as market values change
  in MoneyMoney.
- **Assessment:** Valuable for parity with MoneyMoney but requires careful
  design. MoneyMoneyâ€™s API only exposes point-in-time balances, so we must
  guarantee idempotent reconciliation entries and ensure we do not spam Actual
  with noise when markets fluctuate daily. Coordination with Story 8.3â€™s
  importer refactor feels mandatory to keep the pipeline understandable.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Expand the importer to fetch current balance snapshots for off-budget
    accounts and compare them with Actualâ€™s recorded totals.
  - Generate reconciliation transactions that capture gains/losses with clear
    memos (`Off-budget balance sync`) and attach them to a configurable
    reconciliation category.
  - Expose CLI/config toggles to opt-in per account and document how the
    synthetic entries appear in Actual.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Importer.ts`, `src/utils/config.ts`,
  `src/commands/import.command.ts`, `tests/Importer.test.ts`, docs.

#### Task 10.3a â€“ Model configuration for off-budget balance sync

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Allow accounts to opt into reconciliation, including category
  mapping and memo defaults.

#### Task 10.3b â€“ Implement reconciliation transaction generation

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Extend importer logic to compute deltas, emit transactions, and
  ensure idempotency across runs.

#### Task 10.3c â€“ Add tests and documentation for off-budget sync

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Cover positive/negative delta cases in unit tests and update
  README/backlog guidance for operators.

### Story 10.4 â€“ Map MoneyMoney categories to Actual budget categories

- **Complexity:** 5 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Current Behaviour:** Imports preserve MoneyMoney category names verbatim,
  leaving users to manually remap transactions in Actual even when MoneyMoney
  already applied rules.
- **Assessment:** Reasonable stretch goal once configuration ergonomics improve.
  Requires confirmation that we can reliably address Actual categories by stable
  IDs (not display names) and that MoneyMoney exports carry sufficient
  identifiers. We should prototype config ergonomics alongside Story 2.1â€™s
  normalisation so category lookups happen in a deterministic order.
- **Next Steps:**
  - Introduce an optional category translation table that resolves MoneyMoney
    category identifiers to Actual category IDs or names.
  - Update importer flows to apply translations with validation for unmapped
    categories and clear logging when fallbacks are used.
  - Provide configuration and CLI documentation showing how to enable, seed, and
    test the mapping.
- **Key Files:** `src/utils/Importer.ts`, `src/utils/config.ts`, `README.md`,
  `tests/Importer.test.ts`.

#### Task 10.4a â€“ Define category translation configuration

- **Complexity:** 3 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Extend the config schema with optional mapping blocks and surface
  validation errors when categories are missing.

#### Task 10.4b â€“ Apply translations and add coverage

- **Complexity:** 2 pts
- **Status:** â¬œ Not started
- **Notes:** Update importer logic/tests to apply mappings, ensuring unlisted
  categories fall back gracefully with warnings.
