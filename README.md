## Installation

Install with NPM:

```bash
npm i -g actual-monmon
```

The application will be accessible as a CLI tool with the name `actual-monmon`.

## Dependencies

- Node.js **v20.9.0 or newer** (see `package.json` `engines` field)
- A licensed copy of MoneyMoney on macOS to access the transaction database

**Note on zod version**: This project must remain on zod v3 due to a peer
dependency conflict with the openai package. We currently depend on
`zod@^3.25.76`, which keeps us on the 3.x line (openai requires `^3.23.8`) while
still allowing Dependabot to deliver minor and patch releases. We'll move to zod
v4 once openai ships a compatible update.

## Developer Onboarding

New to the project? Follow these steps to get your development environment
ready:

1. Confirm you are running Node.js **v20.9.0 or newer**.
1. Install dependencies after cloning the repository:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
1. Run the local smoke test to ensure linting, type checks, the build, and tests
   all pass:
   ```bash
   npm run ci:local
   ```
1. Read through the detailed [contributor guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for workflow
   expectations, helpful scripts, and documentation requirements.

The [Development](#development) section later in this document highlights the
most frequently used scripts if you need a quick refresher.

## Configuration

The application needs to be configured with a TOML document to function. By
default, Actual-MoneyMoney stores and reads configuration files from
`~/.actually/config.toml`.

You can validate (and automatically create) your configuration by running
`actual-monmon validate`. If the configuration file does not exist yet, the
command will create a starter file at the resolved path (default:
`~/.actually/config.toml`). When the file already exists, `validate` leaves it
unchanged and only reports schema issues. You can point to a different location
with the `--config <path>` option when running any command.

For detailed command-line options, run `actual-monmon --help`.

### Basic Configuration

A basic configuration document looks like this:

```toml
# Payee transformation
[payeeTransformation]
enabled = false
openAiApiKey = "<openAiKey>"  # Your OpenAI API key
openAiModel = "gpt-3.5-turbo"  # Optional: Specify the OpenAI model to use
# maskPayeeNamesInLogs = true     # Optional: keep payee names obfuscated in payee transformation debug logs

# Import settings
[import]
importUncheckedTransactions = true
synchronizeClearedStatus = true
# maskPayeeNamesInLogs = true  # Optional: replace payee names in import logs with deterministic placeholders

# Actual servers, you can add multiple servers
[[actualServers]]
serverUrl = "http://localhost:5006"
serverPassword = "<password>"
# requestTimeoutMs = 45000  # Optional: Override the Actual server request timeout (milliseconds)
# max 300000

# Budgets for the server, you can add multiple budgets
[[actualServers.budgets]]
syncId = "<syncId>" # Get this value from the Actual advanced settings

# E2E encryption for the budget, if enabled
[actualServers.budgets.e2eEncryption]
enabled = false
password = ""

# Account map for the budget
[actualServers.budgets.accountMapping]
# The key is either the account name, or the account number of a MoneyMoney account
# The value is the account name or the account id (from the url) of the Actual account
"<monMonAcc>" = "<actualAcc>"
```

### Advanced Configuration

For advanced configuration options including custom AI prompts, model-specific
settings, and comprehensive examples, see the
[advanced configuration example](./example-config-advanced.toml) file. This file
demonstrates:

- Custom AI prompts for payee transformation
- Model-specific configuration (temperature, max tokens, timeout)
- Multiple server and budget configurations
- E2E encryption settings
- Ignore patterns for transaction filtering
- Privacy controls for payee logging
- Detailed model compatibility information

### Payee Transformation

The payee transformation feature automatically converts payee names to
human-readable formats (e.g., "AMAZN S.A.R.L" to "Amazon"). To use this feature:

1. Set `enabled = true` in the `[payeeTransformation]` section
1. Provide a valid OpenAI API key (generate one at
   [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
1. Optionally customize the AI model and settings
1. (Optional) Set `skipModelValidation = true` if you want to trust the
   configured model identifier without contacting the OpenAI model listing
   endpoint

By default, payee transformation debug logs mask payee names unless you opt out
with `maskPayeeNamesInLogs = false`. This keeps sensitive payee data hidden even
when running with verbose logging levels.

Importer debug logs display raw payee names unless you enable
`maskPayeeNamesInLogs`. When masking is enabled, payees are replaced with
deterministic placeholders (e.g., `PAYEE#1234ABCD`) so you can still trace
individual entries without exposing the original names. Note:
`[payeeTransformation].maskPayeeNamesInLogs` controls PayeeTransformer debug
logs, while `[import].maskPayeeNamesInLogs` controls Importer logs.

#### Custom Prompts

You can override the default AI classification prompt with your own
instructions:

```toml
[payeeTransformation]
customPrompt = """
Your custom classification instructions here...
Make sure to instruct the model to return valid JSON.
"""
```

#### Model Configuration

Advanced model settings can be configured:

```toml
[payeeTransformation.modelConfig]
temperature = 0.0  # 0.0 = deterministic, 1.0 = creative (0.0-2.0)
maxTokens = 1000   # Maximum tokens in response
timeout = 30000    # Request timeout in milliseconds
```

**Note**: GPT-4o and GPT-5 models accept temperatures between 0.0 and 2.0. They
default to ~0.7 but you can override this for deterministic behavior.

Model validation and payee lookups are cached to keep imports fast and avoid
unnecessary OpenAI requests. The model list is stored for one hour in the
application data directory, and transformed payee names are memoized within a
single import run. Combine these caches with `skipModelValidation = true` if
your environment restricts model listing requests.

### Configuration Summary

- **Payee transformation**: Automatically standardize payee names using AI
- **Import settings**: Customize import behavior (unchecked transactions,
  cleared status, payee masking in logs)
- **Actual servers**: Specify which Actual Budget servers to import to
- **Budget configurations**: Define budget files per server with sync IDs
- **E2E encryption**: Handle encrypted budget files
- **Account mapping**: Map MoneyMoney accounts to Actual accounts
- **Ignore patterns**: Filter transactions with case-insensitive `*` wildcards
  for comments, payees, and purposes

## Usage

### Validation

Before importing, validate your configuration:

```bash
actual-monmon validate
```

You can increase or decrease CLI verbosity with `--logLevel` (`0 = ERROR`,
`1 = WARN`, `2 = INFO`, `3 = DEBUG`). Combine it with `--config` to validate a
different configuration file, and use `--structuredLogs` when you need
machine-readable JSON output for log aggregation:

```bash
actual-monmon validate --config ./config.toml --logLevel 3
```

### Import Transactions

To import transactions:

```bash
actual-monmon import
```

You can limit the scope of an import with additional flags:

- `--server <url>` ‚Äì import only budgets associated with the specified Actual
  server URL. Repeat the flag to include multiple servers.
- `--budget <syncId>` ‚Äì restrict imports to the given Actual budget sync ID.
  Repeat for multiple budgets.
- `--account <ref>` ‚Äì import transactions from a specific MoneyMoney account
  reference.
- `--from YYYY-MM-DD` / `--to YYYY-MM-DD` ‚Äì bound the transaction date range.
- `--dry-run` ‚Äì simulate the import without persisting any changes.
- `--logLevel <0-3>` ‚Äì control CLI verbosity (defaults to `2`, INFO).
- `--structuredLogs` ‚Äì emit JSON-formatted logs instead of coloured text.
- `--config <path>` ‚Äì load a configuration file from a custom path.

### Command Options

For all available commands and options:

```bash
actual-monmon --help
```

## Development

For detailed workflows, see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md). Helpful npm
scripts when working on the project:

- `npm run lint:eslint` ‚Äì run ESLint against the TypeScript sources.
- `npm run lint:complexity` ‚Äì enforce the cyclomatic (max 40) and cognitive (max
  60\) complexity budgets for the source tree.
- `npm run lint:prettier` ‚Äì check formatting with Prettier.
- `npm run typecheck` ‚Äì perform a strict TypeScript type check without emitting
  files.
- `npm run build` ‚Äì compile the CLI for distribution.
- `npm test` ‚Äì execute the Vitest suite.
- `npm run ci:local` ‚Äì chain the same lint/type/build/test steps used in CI.

Markdown files are formatted with `mdformat` (CodeRabbit runs it during review).
Run `mdformat <files>` locally when updating docs to keep diffs clean.

The repository includes Husky hooks to keep the working tree clean:

- `pre-commit` runs `npm run lint:prettier`, `npm run lint:eslint`, and
  `npm run lint:complexity` to block formatting, lint, or complexity violations.
- `pre-push` runs `npm run ci:local` so that pushes only succeed when the entire
  local CI suite is green.

Tests exist to guard the most important scenarios. Keep the high-value suites
running, but there is no expectation of exhaustive coverage or 100% coverage.

## Account Mapping

Account mapping connects MoneyMoney accounts to Actual Budget accounts:

**MoneyMoney accounts** can be identified by:

1. UUID (via AppleScript API)
1. Account number (IBAN, credit card number, etc.)
1. Account name

**Actual accounts** can be identified by:

1. UUID (from browser URL)
1. Account name

If multiple accounts have the same name, the first match will be used. When an
import runs without account filters, any mapping that cannot be resolved will
fail the run so you can fix the configuration instead of importing a partial
set of accounts.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Configuration validation errors**: Run `actual-monmon validate` to see
   detailed error messages
1. **Import failures**: Check your server URLs, passwords, and sync IDs
1. **Payee transformation not working**: Verify your OpenAI API key and model
   settings
1. **Account mapping issues**: Ensure account names/IDs match exactly. The
   importer fails fast when a configured mapping cannot be resolved during an
   unconstrained import.

### Getting Help

- Run `actual-monmon --help` for command-line options
- Use `actual-monmon validate` to check your configuration
- Check the [advanced configuration example](./example-config-advanced.toml) for
  complex setups
- Review the configuration schema and error messages for specific issues
